# Sugar-free Carrot and Date Cake

makes 8″ cake or 12 cupcakes (half recipe in parentheses)

## Ingredients

200g   (100g)    plain flour
3 tsp  (1.5 tsp) baking powder
1 tsp  (.5 tsp)  ground nutmeg
1 tsp  (.5 tsp)  ground cinnamon
130g   (65g)     dates, stones removed, and finely chopped
50g    (25g)     shredded or dessicated coconut
110g   (55g)     butter, melted
110g   (55g)     sultanas (golden raisins)
1 cup  (1/2 cup) grated carrot (about 1 (.5) large carrot)
2 tbsp (1 tbsp)  milk
2      (1)       eggs, lightly beaten

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 150°C (300°F). Lightly grease an 8″ round cake tin and line the bottom with baking paper, or use cupcake liners.

Sift the flour, baking powder and ground spices together. Give it a good stir to make sure it’s evenly combined. Stir through the dates and coconut.

Combine the melted butter, sultanas, carrot and milk (I use the saucepan I melted the butter in). Add to the dry ingredients and mix gently until evenly combined. You should have a very thick mixture. Add the eggs and give it a good stir.

Spoon into the prepared tin and bake in the oven for 45 – 60 minutes (about 30 mins for cupcakes) until done when tested with a skewer.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes, then turn onto a wire rack, removing the baking paper, to cool completely. Store in a tin or wrapped in foil until ready to use. Decorate just before serving.

# Cream Cheese Frosting

makes enough to generously frost 12 cupcakes (half recipe in parentheses)

## Ingredients

2   (1)    8-ounce packages cream cheese, softened
.5  (.25)  cup butter, softened
3   (1.5)  cups confectioner's sugar, sifted
1.5 (.75) tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

Cream cream cheese with an electric mixer.

Add in butter and cream together with cream cheese until light and fluffy.

Add confectioner's sugar, 1/2 a cup at a time. After each cup has been incorporated, turn the mixer onto the highest speed setting and for about 10 seconds to lighten the frosting.

Add in vanilla and beat until well-blended, light and fluffy.

Frost cakes and store in refrigerator.

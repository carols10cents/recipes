## Ingredients

for 6 servings

* ¼ cup olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling
* 20 oz riced or grated cauliflower
* 5 oz leek, tough green ends removed, cut into half moons and rinsed (alternate: shallot, onion, green onion)
* 5 cloves garlic, smashed
* 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus 2 teaspoons, divided, plus more to taste
* 4 cups vegetable stock
* 1 ½ cups non-dairy milk, plus more to taste, divided (alternate: regular milk, coconut milk)
* 10 oz asparagus, woody stems removed, cut into 1/2 in (1 1/4 cm) pieces (small enough to fit on a spoon)
* 1 lemon, zest and juice
* ¼ cup fresh basil, plus more for garnish (alternate: dried basil plus fresh cilantro for garnish)
* 1 ½ lb medium red potato, cut into 1/2 in (1 1/4 cm) cubes (alternate: regular potatoes)
* cold water
* freshly ground black pepper, for garnish
* cheese, for garnish 
* oyster crackers, for garnish

## Instructions

* In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the riced cauliflower, leeks, garlic, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Sauté for 2 minutes, until the leeks just begin to soften.

* Pour in the vegetable stock and 1 ½ cups of non-dairy milk. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the cauliflower is completely broken down and tender.

* Meanwhile, in a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the asparagus and 1 teaspoon of salt. Sauté for 2 minutes, until the vegetables are bright green with some crunch. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the lemon zest and basil. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

* Wipe out the pan and add the potatoes and enough cold water to cover by 1 inch. Season with 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 8-10 minutes, until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork but not mushy. Drain and set aside.

* Remove the pot with the cauliflower from the heat. Blend with an immersion blender until completely smooth and creamy. Add up to 1 cup non-dairy milk or water if needed to thin to your desired consistency.

* Stir in the reserved asparagus, potatoes, and the lemon juice. Season to taste with salt.

* Ladle into bowls and garnish with fresh basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and freshly ground black pepper.

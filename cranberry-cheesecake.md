# Crust


8 whole graham crackers
½ cup pecans
3 tablespoon light brown sugar, packed
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.

Butter a 9-inch nonstick springform pan.

Put the graham crackers, pecans (if using), brown sugar and spices in a food processor and pulse until the mixture becomes a fine crumb.

Drizzle the melted butter on top and pulse until just mixed.

Press the mixture into the bottom of either the springform or the pie pan.

Place the crust in the oven for 10 minutes or until it starts to turn a little golden.

When done, set the crust aside to cool.




# Filling

Reduce oven to 325.

3 package cream cheese
¾ c. sour cream
2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
3 large eggs
3/4 c sugar
1 teaspoon lemon extract
zest from 1 lemon, very fine
1-1/2 cups chopped fresh or frozen cranberries

Using your food processor, process the cream cheese until smooth.

Add the sour cream, flour, egg, sugar, lemon extract and lemon zest and process again until smooth and fully combined.

Fold in cranberries.

Pour into crust.

Bake  45 to 50 minutes, until cheesecake is set around the edges and the center jiggles just slightly when nudged.

Transfer the cheesecake to a wire rack and let cool completely in the pan, then refrigerate, loosely covered, for at least 4 hours or overnight.
